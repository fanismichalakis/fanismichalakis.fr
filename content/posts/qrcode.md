Black squares on a white background\
You are either freedom or subjection\
Message to come or prison of paper\
Strange chessboard without pawn or king

Deceitful *s√©same*,\
Or key to millions.

Each point on this map is a nail in the coffin\
We always bury something.

In the end we are all smiths,\
All cartographers, all kings and pawns\
And it's up to us to ignore the jesters\
And their black squares on a white background
